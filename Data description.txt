1) Resume Names 
Cross-section data about resume, call-back and employer information for 4,870 fictitious 
resumes sent in response to employment advertisements in Chicago and Boston in 2001, in a 
randomized controlled experiment. The resumes contained information concerning the 
ethnicity of the applicant. Because ethnicity is not typically included on a resume, resumes 
were differentiated on the basis of so-called “Caucasian sounding names” (such as Emily 
Walsh or Gregory Baker) and “African American sounding names” (such as Lakisha 
Washington or Jamal Jones). A large collection of fictitious resumes were created and the presupposed ethnicity (based on the sound of the name) was randomly assigned to each resume. 
These resumes were sent to prospective employers to see which resumes generated a phone 
call from the prospective employer
